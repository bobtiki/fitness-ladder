# Fitness Ladder

Based on the [Fitness Ladder exercise program](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html) by [John Walker](http://www.fourmilab.ch/).

This is a very simple JavaScript web app to keep track of which rung of the Fitness Ladder you are on. The web page simply writes a cookie to keep track of which rung you last used. No other personal data is recorded.

If you need help with learning what the exercises are, check out the Fitness Ladder link above.

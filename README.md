# Fitness Ladder

Based on the [Fitness Ladder exercise program](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html) by [John Walker](http://www.fourmilab.ch/).

This is a very simple JavaScript web app to keep track of which rung of the Fitness Ladder you are on. The web page simply writes a cookie to keep track of which rung you last used. No other personal data is recorded.

If you need help with learning what the exercises are, check out the Fitness Ladder link above.

## Installation

Just grab the files and put 'em up on a web server somewhere. It should just work in any browser that supports JavaScript and cookies.

## Usage

Tap the up or down chevron at the top to go to a higher or lower rung. The app will save a cookie on your browser that will remember where you were the next time you load the page, and load the correct rung.

If you want to remove the cookie from your system, there is a "click here to delete the cookie" link in the fine print at the bottom of the page. Otherwise, the cookie will stick around for up to five years.

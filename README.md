# Fitness Ladder

Based on the [Fitness Ladder exercise program](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html) as part of the [The Hackerâ€™s Diet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) book by [John Walker](http://www.fourmilab.ch/).

This is a very simple JavaScript web app to keep track of which rung of the Fitness Ladder you are on. The web page simply writes a cookie to keep track of which rung you last used. No other personal data is recorded. If you need help with learning what the exercises are, check out the [Fitness Ladder exercise program](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html) page.
